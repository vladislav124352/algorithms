#
# Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting
# algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each
# pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements
# are swapped if they are not in order. This algorithm is
# not suitable for large data sets as its average and
# worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n2) where n is the number
# of items.
