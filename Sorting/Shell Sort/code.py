# Shell Sort
#
# TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n^2)
# MEMORY COMPLEXITY: O(n)
#
# The Shell sort algorithm is an advanced version of sorting.
# inserts. The idea of the Shell method is to compare elements 
# that are not only side by side, but also at a certain 
# distance from each other. In other words, this insertion 
# sorting with preliminary "rough" passes.
#
# The optimality of the algorithm depends on the choice of the
# step Sorting shells. Find out the dependence of the efficiency 
# of the algorithm on the method step selection, 
# implementation code changed. Now the step calculation is 
# done with using an external tool.
# 
# The following methods are used to calculate the step:
# - Donald Shell O(N2) 
# - Knuth O(N3/2) - recommended
# - Hibbard O(N3/2) 
# - Sedgwick O(N4/3) 
# - Prat O(Nâˆ™ln(N)2)
