# Algorithms

Hi, this is a project with a lot of algorithms for searching, sorting, calculations (soon), combinatorics (soon), data processing (soon), etc.  
You can use them algorithms and add your own if you like.  

## Get the code

```console
git clone https://github.com/vladislav124352/algorithms.git
```

## Development plan:

1. Add even more algorithms
2. Add description and examples for algorithms
3. Add examples of problems solved using these algorithms.
